These kids walk to school alongside their parents and most have never been further than walking distance from their house. For 80% of my students, English is not their first language or the language spoken at home. \r\n\r\nWhile my kindergarten kids have many obstacles in front of them, they come to school each day excited and ready to learn. Most students started the year out never being in a school setting. At the start of the year many had never been exposed to letters. Each day they soak up more knowledge and try their hardest to succeed. They are highly motivated to learn new things every day. We are halfway through the year and they are starting to take off. They know know all letters, some sight words, numbers to 20, and a majority of their letter sounds because of their hard work and determination. I am excited to see the places we will go from here!";I currently have a differentiated sight word center that we do daily during our literacy stations. The students have activities that relate to whatever sight word list they are on. This is one of their favorite station activities. I want to continue to provide the students with engaging ways to practice their sight words. \r\n\r\nI dream of having the students use QR readers to scan the sight words that they are struggling with and the Ipods reading the sight words with them. This would help so many of my students by giving them multiple exposures to the words. My students need someone who can go over these sight words daily and I can't always get around to everyone to practice their flashcards with them. With the Ipods they would still have a way to practice their sight words on a daily basis.;UNKOWN;UNKOWN;My students need 6 Ipod Nano's to create and differentiated and engaging way to practice sight words during a literacy station.;26;1;Friday;2016;11;4;November;14;45;59;18.11.2016

We also serve two foster group homes for temporary and long-term placement of homeless children. \r\nWe do not see these statistics as road blocks. We see them as additions to our rich diversity.  Together we will help students to develop to their fullest potential: Creative, problem-solving,  compassionate adults.;We strive to provide our diverse population of  students with not only extra curricular activities, but an outlet for them to express themselves creatively.As a teacher,  I have organized a dance club for lower elementary that meets once a week after school.\r\n\r\n This gives the girls something to look forward to, fosters the education of the whole child, and creates a social environment for our varied cultural student body. \r\n\r\nSince beginning our dance club, I have watched our girls who normally are introverts, bloom with excitement.

We are an inner city school being limited to doing all activities in (PE) Physical Education inside because we have violence at the location where our school is located.  All the physical activities the students are active with are within the school so we have to have a good program.\r\n\r\nMost of the students are either African American or Hispanic.

In my elective class my students have a garden in which we grow our own food and make healthy meals within the kitchen.  My students love cooking from scratch and being creative with their meals. Most of my students don't know how to cook from scratch, but they learn all of the basics in my classroom.  If you don't have health, nothing else seems to matter.;For some reason in our kitchen the water comes out from the faucet white looking and not clear like most water that comes from the faucet.  We are not exactly sure why that is, but the students are wary of using that water for their cooking or drinking.  After much online research we feel that the Berkey Water Filtration system would be an ideal solution to our water problem.  Although the water in Compton is probably fine to drink, it would be better for us to err on the side of caution and have our water filtered before we cook with it or drink it.;UNKOWN;UNKOWN;My students need a water filtration system for our culinary arts class.;42;1;Saturday;2016;8;5;August;9;9;11;06.08.2016

They just need more support!\r\n\r\n;I started a program called Telementoring in hopes that each of my students would receive a virtual mentor.  The response has been awesome.  Adults are providing the much needed encouragement, support and motivation that my students need.\r\n\r\nThe students' writing has improved tremendously and they are also progressing in reading.  This is aided by their online interaction with their mentors.\r\n\r\nI need the tablets so I can set up a mentoring station.  This would allow for more students to participate daily and expedite academic and social growth.

My students are held to high expectations in Kindergarten which include learning how to read, addition and subtraction among other things. They are still young! Our biggest challenges are our attention spans and sitting still. We take many dance breaks throughout the day but we always need some sort of outlet for our excess energy. \r\n      My students love superheroes, Minecraft, Barbies, and recess, of course. We have many opportunities during the day for play but it never seems to be enough for these kiddos. They have huge imaginations and tons of creativity to boot. The students in my classroom come from diverse socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. I have special needs students in my classroom as well as a highly transient population.;"With balance discs and stools as flexible seating, my students will have choice when in our classroom. This will help prepare them for the real world. I hope to create self-regulated learners. When giving students choice they will be able to hopefully make a safe choice for themselves and also meet their own sensory needs. These students should be able to learn and grow in an environment suited to their needs. At this age they need to be active. They will learn better with an outlet for their \""fidgets.\"" Focus will improve and more learning will get done.\r\n\r\nWith these donations, I hope to help students' attention spans, which will result in higher achievement and also create more opportunities for active engagement in the classroom.\r\nI want to motivate students to want to come to school and learn!

Many of my students are in need of an active learning environment.  We are so thankful for any donation you can give to help us reach our goal. Thank you!";First graders love learning! We need 6 wiggle-stools to allow students to wiggle while they learn. This will keep their brains and bodies active! As an educator, I've spent time researching the best practices for my students. One of the most common strategies I've seen is keeping students active! That being said, these stools will go to good use! \r\n\r\nFirst graders learn well in small group scenarios, with the chance to move around while learning reading, writing, math, and science.\r\nWe plan to use these stools at our small-group learning table while teaching reading, writing, and math.

They can't wait to go to college and they dream of college and careers in healthcare and engineering and law. But to get to those goals they are going to have to work pretty hard to overcome some obstacles. Almost all of my students qualify for a free or reduced lunch. 65% of my students perform below grade level on standardized tests. 30% are learning English in middle school and 25% have a learning disability that impacts their academic performance. Despite all of this, my students work hard every single day to try to close these gaps.;I have used alternative seating in my classroom for years to help my most active students. I have seen a huge growth in student engagement that translates to a big increase in student grades and in test scores. \r\n\r\nI want to reach all the students, including the students who need to move while they learn. I have used exercise ball chairs and chairs with wheels, but after trying these wobble stools, I can't wait to have some in my classroom.  They are durable and fun and will allow students to move around without distracting the students around them. \r\n\r\nMy students love that they have a choice about where to sit, and thinking about what type of seat helps them learn the most helps them develop self awareness and be better advocates for their own education.;UNKOWN;UNKOWN;My students need seating that allows the most fidgety of them to move around while they are learning.

My goal for all my students is to give each and every one of them the SAME opportunity to learn with every advantage possible.\r\n\r\nIf I can accomplish one thing in the short time I have my students, it would be that know that I truly love and value them as individuals.\r\n\r\n;"There is nothing better than snuggling up with a good book and getting lost in it.  I strive to create a love reading by motivating students to want to read.  For that past several years I have been adding furniture such as a couch, pillows, and a tent for students to \""snuggle up\"" and read a book.  I would love to add these 2 reclining chairs for students to cozy up in while reading. Currently not all students have a comfortable space for reading.  By adding these two recliners more students would be able to have a space during reading time. \r\nI have seen first hand students develop a love for reading because they are able to get comfortable.

By having seat sacks, these children would be able to keep their work in one place and go back to it. Our reading can be kept nearby for them to reread over and over.;In our classroom, we use dry erase boards throughout every subject and lesson. These dry erase boards give our kiddos the opportunity to express their thinking individually. From this, I can see where the children are in their learning and where they need to go. \r\nThe children also use these dry erase boards to do independent work. They love to write and write even during free time.
